Advanced Topics in Web and Mobile Applications

## Assignment Description

This assignment consists of multiple small JavaScript programs designed to practice core JavaScript fundamentals such as variables, user input, conditionals, loops, math operations, and console output.

Each exercise is implemented in its own JavaScript file and can be executed independently from the main HTML page.

## Program Overview

### 1. Larger or Smaller
Prompts the user for two integers and displays the larger value.  
If both numbers are equal, an appropriate message is shown.

### 2. Coin Flip Game
Simulates a coin flip using a random number.  
The user chooses Heads or Tails and is informed whether they won or lost.

---

### 3. Coin Flip Redux
Simulates 10 coin flips and logs “Heads” or “Tails” for each flip in the console.

---

### 4. Coin Flip Streak
Continuously flips a coin until Tails occurs.  
Each result is logged to the console to show the streak of Heads.

---

### 5. Looping a Triangle
Displays a triangle pattern made of `#` characters in the console.

---

### 6. Odd or Even
Iterates from 0 to 15 and logs whether each number is odd or even.

---

### 7. Marco! Polo!
Iterates from 1 to 100 and replaces numbers based on divisibility rules.

---

### 8. Countdown
Prompts the user for a number and counts down to 0 in the console.

## Implementation Notes

- Each exercise is wrapped in a function and runs only when selected using a button.
- This prevents all scripts from executing automatically on page load.
- Program logic strictly follows the assignment requirements.
